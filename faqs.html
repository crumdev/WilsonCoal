      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h3>Why should I buy a Coal stove instead of wood or gas?</h3>
      <p>Coal is the most economical form of heating on the market today compared to wood, oil, electric, propane, or natural gas. With all the types of home heating choices available to the 
        consumer Coal gives you the highest rating per million BTU's at the lowest price.</p>
      <h3>Do I need a masonry chimney to use a coal stove?</h3>
      <p>No. Although a masonry chimney is an option, there are other options available. A Powervent or a Direct vent is available for stoker models of stoves, as well as some furnaces and boilers we sell. A Class-A Stainless Steel All Fuel Chimney System may also be used for venting. Contact both your homeowners insurance and consult with your local code enforcement before installing any stove.  Also check the Owner&rsquo;s Manual for specifications.</p>
      <h3>How do I start my stove?</h3>
      <p>There are a variety of ways to start your stove but the easiest is to use our Fire Starter Bags available at our showroom or delivered with your coal order. Charcoal is another 
        option.</p>
      <h3>How does the Field Controls Powervent for stoker stoves work?</h3>
      <p>The Field Controls 4&rdquo; or 5&rdquo; Power Vent is the safest, most efficient power vent available today. The vent combines the motor, blower, and vent hood in one complete, easy to install unit. The SWG mounts on the outside of the building and pulls the combustion gases from the appliance through the outside wall utilizing 100% negative pressure.  Standard 6&rdquo; stove pipe and a Field Controls adjustable Barometric Damper are also required.</p>
      <h3>I have a chimney that my Oil Burner is connected to. Can I use this for my stove?</h3>
      <p>Unless there is a double flue system inside the chimney the answer is NO!  Each heating system requires its own ventilation.</p>
      <h3>Is it necessary to install a Barometric Damper on my stove?</h3>
      <p>Yes!  Barometric Dampers are necessary to maximize the efficient burning and capabilities of the stove. Do not operate any coal stove without a Barometric Damper.</p>
      <h3>If you vent one of our stoves out of the bottom back vent is a Damper still necessary?</h3>
      <p>Yes! It should be installed as close to the stove as possible.</p>
      <h3>What size Coal does a stoker stove use?</h3>
      <p>Our stoker stoves can burn Anthracite Rice or Buckwheat Coal. </p>
      <h3>How long will a full hopper last?</h3>
      <p>It depends on the individual requirement demands placed on the unit. Our stoker stoves come with either a Coal-Trol Thermostat or a standard Honeywell Thermostat.  You also can upgrade to a 7 day programmable thermostat on stoves without the Coal-Trol. For example: The Allegheny Stove by Reading Stoves can burn as little as 20 pounds a coal a day to as high as 75 pounds depending on how cold it is and if the thermostat is calling for additional heat. The important thing is the stove will burn efficiently and deliver a reliable steady heat source.</p>
      <h3>Will these Stoves heat my entire house?</h3>
      <p>Yes. An 85,000 BTU stove can heat a 1200-2500 sq. foot home depending on the energy efficiency and the floor plan of the home. Location of the stove, age and condition of the house, 
        insulation r-factor, and the amount of doors and windows all play a part in the stoves heating capabilities. Generally speaking these units do a wonderful job covering a 1200 to 2500 squ
        are foot area with warm even heat.</p>
      <h3><strong>Can I burn Wood in my Coal Stove?</strong></h3>
      <p>Our stoves are made to be Coal burning stoves only.  Some of the models available are designed to be both Wood and Coal burners.  Check the descriptions on our Stoves tabs to see which model is best for you!  Never use wood to start a stoker unit.  We sell specially made fire-starter packets or blocks for this!</p>
      <h3>How hot do the stoves get?</h3>
      <p>Depending on the model, the outer surface temperature of the stove can range from 250 to 650 degrees Fahrenheit, so they do get hot. Remember they are stoves, they contain fire, and 
        fire is hot. It is always recommended to keep Children and pets at a safe distance.</p>
      <h3>What kind of fire retardant material is necessary when installing my Stove?</h3>
      <p> UL-1618 Type I and II Hearth Pads are approved for all coal stoves. The stove is designed as such that the fire and heat are concentrated and contained to the body of the stove. 
        Therefore by the time the ashes reach the pan they are partially cooled. The Floor Pad will also protect your carpet from careless ash spills.</p>
      <h3><strong>What happens if my power goes out?  Will my stoker stove still work?</strong></h3>
      <p>No. Stoker Stoves require a continuous flow of air from the combustion blower. If the power goes out expect to lose the fire within 10-15 minutes. Battery backup systems are available through Wilson Coal and Supply. A gas-powered generator must have clean power.  A top quality generator will not fluctuate your voltage and frequency. Our stoves are low amps and will not require a large power source.</p>
      <h3>Why doesn't the fire go up into the hopper?</h3>
      <p>Because of the design on the stoker fire plate there is a limited space containing holes that allows air to reach the coal being fed to the firebox. Those holes end well in advance of 
        the hopper coal thereby cutting off the air supply. Remember no air no fire.</p>
      <h3>Can I keep the fire burning when I leave the house?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Stoker Stoves are designed to burn 24-7 throughout the heating season. If you keep coal in the hopper and empty the ashes your stove can run unattended providing uninterrupted 
        heat during the heating season.</p>
      <h3>How often should I service my stove?</h3>
      <p>Wilson Coal and Supply recommends that consumers clean a stoker coal stove every 6 weeks and full cleaning and visual inspection at the end of the heating season. Removing the firebox 				
        plate and vacuuming the dust and ash particles out of the box insures an unobstructed airflow and a clean, even burning fire. Consistent burning will keep your stove cleaner longer. 			
        Proper cleaning is outlined in the owner's manuals. </p>
      <h3><strong>How long is the warranty on coal stoves?</strong></h3>
      <p>The warranty on our stoves vary by the manufacturers from 4-10 years on the stove body and 1-2 year for electrical parts. Regular maintenance will prolong the life of the stove and parts; the better you care for your stove the longer it lasts. Some stoker and handfired stoves have been around for 30 plus years, so you are the one to determine its longevity.</p>
      <h3>What is the life span on the steel components?</h3>
      <p>That depends on the individual. Regular care and maintenance will provide many years of trouble free operation for your coal Stove. However neglect, improper set-up, location, and abuse
        will all play a factor in a shorter life span.</p>
      <h3>What is the life span on the door glass?</h3>
      <p>The door glass can last the life of the stove. It is the glass clarity that becomes affected by the heat of constant burning. A damp cloth used regularly can improve the life of glass 
        clarity. However for perfectly clear glass it will need to be replaced every 1-2 years.</p>
      <h3>Does the finish on the Lehigh models stay glossy?</h3>
      <p>Yes. The coating is a baked enamel type finish holding up to constant high temperatures. You may notice a darkening, or lightening of the color after constant use but the shine should 
        last.</p>
      <h3>Will the stove make my house dirty and dusty?</h3>
      <p>Because of the stoves design any contaminants are contained in the firebox and ashpan. And because these are stoker type stoves and have no moving grates it eliminates the need for 
        raking making it cleaner than the stoves we remember growing up with. Of course being careful loading the hopper and removing ashes will also aide in the cleanliness factor.</p>
      <h3>How often do I have to empty the ashes?</h3>
      <p> The ashes should be checked every time you add coal to the hopper. Normally the ashes should be removed every 1-3 days depending on the amount of coal you are burning.</p>
      <h3>Are the Coal fumes hazardous to my health?</h3>
      <p>The fumes are no more hazardous than with any other fuel burning fires. The key to any fire is proper ventilation. If properly vented all the danger causing fumes will be dispersed in 
        the outside air, which will allow for a clean, heat producing fire. For your safety, a Carbon Monoxide detector must be used with your coal stove.</p>
      <h3>Are the emissions the same with or without a power vent?</h3>
      <p>Yes. A chimney and damper have the same effect on emission removal as a power vent system. The only difference is that the power vent allows the installation of a stove where a chimney 
        is non-existent, or impractical to build.</p>
      <h3>Is the power vent designed with a safety system?</h3>
      <p>Yes. The power vents are set up to stop operation and shut down the stove in the event of a malfunction. Therefore all fume emissions are ceased and the dangers imposed curtailed.</p>
      <h3>What is the warranty on a power vent system?</h3>
      <p> To be determined but will be based on the warranty from field controls.</p>
      <h3>What type of power do I need for my Stove and/or Power Vent?</h3>
      <p>A regular 110-volt house current is all you need to run your stove, blower, and power vent. Actually the stoves motor requires very little current to operate making it very cost 
        effective.</p>
